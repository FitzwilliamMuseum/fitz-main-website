    <p class="text-black">
      To protect the health and wellbeing of visitors and staff, many of whom are not
      yet fully vaccinated, the Fitzwilliam Museum has decided to maintain a number
      of COVID mitigation measures. These include <strong>strongly encouraging the wearing of
      face coverings</strong> and social distancing as well as ticketing for admissions, reduced
      capacity and regular hand sanitising.
    </p>
    <p class="text-black">
      This reflects industry best practice, visitor sentiment research and guidance
      from the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions and the University of Cambridge.
      The Museum and the Museum Caf√© will continue to display the QR code for the
      NHS Test and Trace App, which visitors are encouraged to use.
